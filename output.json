    "full_text": "Texas Commission on Environmental Quality \nInteroffice Memorandum \n\nTo: \n\nThru: \n\nFrom: \n\nCommissioners \n\nDate: \n\nJuly 3, 2025 \n\nLaurie Gharis, Chief Clerk \nKelly Keel, Executive Director \n\nPhillip Ledbetter, Director   //PL \nOffice of Legal Services \n\nDocket No.:  2023-1506-RUL \n\nSubject: \n\nCommission Approval for Rulemaking Proposal \nChapter 39, Public Notice \nChapter 55, Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; \nPublic Comment \nUpdates to Public Participation Rules to Implement Sunset Legislation \nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS \n\nBackground and reason(s) for the rulemaking: \nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ or commission) underwent \nSunset review during the 88th Regular Legislative Session, 2023. Senate Bill (SB) 1397, \n88th Regular Legislature Session, 2023 (TCEQ\u2019s Sunset bill), continues TCEQ, and requires \nchanges to TCEQ\u2019s public participation rules including an extension of time for filing \nhearing requests and making public comments for certain air permits. Amendments to \nTCEQ\u2019s rules at 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapters 39 and 55 are needed to \nimplement these statutory changes. Additionally, the proposed rulemaking contains \nrevisions intended to provide clarity in the rules and make them easier to understand for \nthe public and regulated entities, including adding definitions of commonly used terms. \nThe rulemaking removes obsolete date references throughout Chapter 39 and corrects \nminor grammatical issues to reflect current correct usage. \n\nScope of the rulemaking: \nThe rule amendments implement changes required by TCEQ\u2019s Sunset bill and include \nrevisions for clarification. Rule amendments include, but are not limited to: extending the \ncomment period and opportunity to request a contested case hearing for at least 36 \nhours following a public meeting for air quality permit applications with consolidated \nNotice of Receipt of Application and Intent to Obtain Permit (NORI) and Notice of \nApplication and Preliminary Decision (NAPD) as described by \u00a739.603(c) and (d) for \napplications received on or after March 1, 2026; changing notice requirements to specify \nthat applications for air quality permits, waste permits, and wastewater and water quality \npermits subject to the requirements of Chapter 39 will be posted electronically by the \nagency; and updating other notice requirements as necessary for implementation of new \nrequirements. \n\nThe agency received public input through a stakeholder process. Although many other \ncomments were beyond the scope of the current rulemaking, there was a general request \nto make the rules less confusing and more helpful to assist the public participation \nprocess. The proposed amendments to Chapter 39, along with the companion rulemaking \nproposing changes to Chapter 55, seek to address comments and improve the clarity and \nreadability of the rules.  \n\n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 2 \nJuly 3, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2023-1506-RUL \n\nA.) Summary of what the rulemaking will do: \nProposed amendments will extend the comment period and opportunity to request a \ncontested case hearing for at least 36 hours following a public meeting for air quality \npermit applications with consolidated NORI and NAPD for applications received on or \nafter March 1, 2026. The amendments also change notice requirements to specify that \napplications for air quality permits, waste permits, and wastewater permits are posted \nelectronically by the agency; and update other notice requirements. The proposed \nrulemaking also seeks to clarify the rules to meet the general Sunset recommendation \nthat the agency improve its public participation process for permit applications. The \nrulemaking will create a new section in 30 TAC Chapter 39, Subchapter K., Public Notice \nof Air Quality Permit Applications, to include the information about requesting a public \nmeeting, a notice and comment hearing, and a contested case hearing for air quality \npermit applications for which these opportunities exist. The rulemaking will also increase \nthe size of the required signs for air quality permit applications to 48 inches by 48 \ninches, with a minimum size of 3 inches for lettering, a size that is consistent with the \nsize of other required signs in the Municipal Solid Waste program. A new Subchapter A \nwill be added to Chapter 39 to define commonly used terms. New definitions are \nproposed to be added to Chapter 55, and language is proposed to clarify processes \nrelating to comments, public meetings, and contested case hearings. The rulemaking \nextends the comment period for certain air quality permit renewal applications based on \na facility\u2019s or applicant\u2019s compliance history, expressly clarifying that more time for \npublic comment is allowed when applicants have a poor compliance history. The \nrulemaking will remove obsolete date references throughout Chapter 39 and correct \nminor grammatical issues to reflect current correct usage. \n\nB.) Scope required by state statutes: \nTCEQ\u2019s Sunset bill requires TCEQ to implement changes relating to public notice. \nSpecifically, TCEQ\u2019s Sunset bill required that air quality permit applications that are \nrequired to publish notice in a consolidated NORI and NAPD must have an extension of \nthe end of the comment period and the opportunity to request a contested case hearing \nto at least 36 hours following a public meeting held on the permit application.  \n\nC.) Additional staff recommendations that are not required by state statute: \nThe proposed rulemaking seeks to clarify the rules relating to the agency\u2019s public \nparticipation process for permit applications. The rulemaking will create a new section in \n30 TAC Chapter 39, Subchapter K, Public Notice of Air Quality Permit Applications, to \ninclude the information about requesting a public meeting, a notice and comment \nhearing, and a contested case hearing for air quality permit applications for which these \nopportunities exist. A new Subchapter A will be added to Chapter 39 to define commonly \nused terms. New definitions are proposed to be added to Chapter 55, and language is \nproposed to clarify processes relating to comments, public meetings, and contested case \nhearings. The rulemaking will also increase the size of the required signs for air quality \npermit applications to 48 inches by 48 inches, with a minimum size of 3 inches for \nlettering. The rulemaking extends the comment period for certain air quality permit \nrenewal applications based on a facility\u2019s or applicant\u2019s compliance history, expressly \nclarifying that more time for public comment is allowed when applicants have a poor \n\n \n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 3 \nJuly 3, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2023-1506-RUL \n\ncompliance history. The rulemaking will remove obsolete date references throughout \nChapter 39 and correct minor grammatical issues to reflect current correct usage.  \n\nStatutory authority: \n\n\u2022  Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.004, which requires state agencies to adopt \n\nprocedural rules;  \n\n\u2022  Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.006, which authorizes state agencies to adopt \nrules or take other administrative action that the agency deems necessary to \nimplement legislation;  \n\n\u2022  Texas Government Code, \u00a72001.142, which provides a time period for presumed \n\nnotification by a state agency; \n\n\u2022  Texas Water Code (TWC), \u00a7\u00a7 5102, 5.103, 5.105, 5.112, 5.129, 5.136, 5.1734, 5.583, \n\n5.584, 5.586, 5.587, 49.011; \n\u2022  TWC, Chapter 5, Subchapter M; \n\u2022  TWC, Chapter 26, Water Quality Control; \n\u2022  TWC, Chapter 27, Injection Well Act; \n\u2022  Texas Health and Safety Code (THSC), Solid Waste Disposal Act, Chapter 361; \n\u2022  THSC, Texas Clean Air Act, \u00a7\u00a7382.011, 382.017, 382.0515, 382.056, and 382.058. \n\nEffect on the: \n\nA.) Regulated community: Permit applicants will have some additional requirements that \nmust be met, including new language in notices. Generally, permit applicants already \nsatisfy these requirements, and any impact is likely to be limited. Increased opportunities \nfor public participation and requests for contested case hearings on certain air quality \npermits may slightly increase the time periods necessary for approval of a permit \napplication. \n\nB.) Public: The public may receive a slight increase in opportunities to participate in a \nlimited set of air permitting activities before the commission. Rule changes providing \nclarity and improving public participation will result in increased transparency that will \nbe in the best interests of the public. \n\nC.) Agency programs: Agency permitting programs must implement a system to \nelectronically post permit applications; however, this has been completed and \nimplemented since July 2024. New notice templates will need to be developed for permit \napplications that will be subject to the new requirements. A limited set of TCEQ-issued \nair permits may experience slight increases in time required for allowing comments on \napplications, and there could be a slight increase in the number of contested case hearing \nrequests and possibly hearings.  \n\nStakeholder meetings: \nThe agency engaged in an expanded stakeholder process for this rulemaking. A hybrid \nvirtual/in-person stakeholder meeting was held in Austin on July 15, 2024, with in-person \nmeeting rooms also open in TCEQ regional offices in Midland and Harlingen. Spanish \nlanguage interpretation was available for this meeting. In-person meetings were held in \n\n \n \n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 4 \nJuly 3, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2023-1506-RUL \n\nArlington on July 16, 2024, and in Houston on July 18, 2024. Because the July 18, 2024 \nmeeting in Houston was shortly after the city experienced Hurricane Beryl, a second in-\nperson meeting was held in Houston on October 3, 2024. Professional Spanish-language \ninterpretation was available at both Houston meetings, and an agency interpreter was \navailable for Spanish language assistance at the Arlington meeting. Stakeholder \ncomments were accepted until October 8, 2024. The agency received input from \nstakeholders during this process, receiving many comments and suggestions for changes \nto improve the agency\u2019s public participation rules.  \n\nPublic Involvement Plan \nYes.  \n\nAlternative Language Requirements \nYes. Spanish.  \n\nPotential controversial concerns and legislative interest: \nA component of the rulemaking is intended to implement Sunset bill requirements and \nSunset Commission recommendations; therefore, legislative interest is likely to be high. \n\nWill this rulemaking affect any current policies or require development of new \npolicies? \nYes. This rulemaking affects current public participation policies for notice requirements, \ncomment period duration, application posting, and hearing requests by implementing the \nrequired changes in the Sunset bill, SB 1397, and recommendations from the Sunset \nCommission.  \n\nWhat are the consequences if this rulemaking does not go forward? Are there \nalternatives to rulemaking? \nThe agency is required to implement the Sunset bill requirements. The agency may \nimplement Sunset recommendations; however, there is flexibility in how those \nrecommendations may be implemented.  \n\nKey points in the adoption rulemaking schedule: \nAnticipated proposal date: July 23, 2025 \nAnticipated Texas Register publication date: August 8, 2025 \nAnticipated public hearing date: September 8, 2025 \nAnticipated public comment period: August 8 \u2013 September 9, 2025 \nAnticipated adoption date: February 2026 \n\nAgency contacts: \nAmy Browning, Rule Project Manager/Staff Attorney, Environmental Law Division, (512) \n239-0891 \nCorey Bowling, Texas Register Rule/Agenda Coordinator, General Law Division, (512) 239-\n6089 \n\nAttachments:  \nTCEQ Sunset Bill, SB 1397, 88th Legislature, 2023 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 5 \nJuly 3, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2023-1506-RUL \n\ncc: \n\nChief Clerk, 2 copies \nExecutive Director's Office \nPatrick Lopez \nJessie Powell \nKrista Kyle \nOffice of General Counsel \nAmy Browning \nCorey Bowling"

Chism, Director   RCC \nOffice of Air \n\nDocket No.: \n\n2025-0339-RUL \n\nSubject: \n\nCommission Approval for Proposed Rulemaking \nChapter 117 NOX Rule Revisions for the Bexar County 2015 Eight Hour Ozone \nSerious Nonattainment Area \nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI \n\nBackground and reason(s) for the rulemaking: \nOn June 20, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the reclassification of \nBexar County from moderate to serious nonattainment for the 2015 eight-hour ozone National \nAmbient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), effective July 22, 2024 (89 Federal Register (FR) 51829). \nBexar County is now subject to the serious nonattainment area requirements in federal Clean Air \nAct (FCAA), \u00a7172(c) and \u00a7182(c), and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ or \ncommission) is required to submit serious area attainment demonstration (AD) and reasonable \nfurther progress (RFP) state implementation plan (SIP) revisions to EPA by January 1, 2026. The \nattainment deadline for the Bexar County serious nonattainment area is September 24, 2027, with \na 2026 attainment year. This rulemaking is necessary to fulfill SIP obligations resulting from the \nBexar County area\u2019s reclassification to serious. \n\nNonattainment areas classified as serious and above are required to meet the mandates of FCAA, \n\u00a7172(c)(1) and \u00a7182(c) and (f). FCAA, \u00a7172(c)(1) requires that the SIP incorporate all reasonably \navailable control measures (RACM), including reasonably available control technology (RACT), as \nexpeditiously as practicable and to provide for attainment of the NAAQS. FCAA, \u00a7182(b)(2) \nrequires the state to implement RACT requirement rules for all categories of stationary sources \nidentified by EPA in an alternative control technique (ACT) document or a control techniques \nguideline (CTG) document, as well as any non-ACT/CTG category sources that are classified as \nmajor stationary sources of nitrogen oxides (NOX) or volatile organic compounds. FCAA, \u00a7182(c) \naddresses the SIP requirements for demonstrating attainment and RFP for areas classified as \nserious. FCAA, \u00a7182(f) requires the state to submit a SIP revision that implements RACT for all \nmajor sources of NOX. This rulemaking would fulfill serious classification NOX RACT requirements \nfor the Bexar County area. Based on photochemical modeling results for future years, the Bexar \nCounty area is projected to meet the 2015 ozone standard without implementing additional \ncontrol measures, and the RACM analysis provided in the concurrently proposed Bexar County \n2015 Ozone NAAQS Serious AD SIP Revision (Non-Rule Project No. 2024-041-SIP-NR) determined \nthat no potential control measures met the criteria to be considered RACM. As a result, no rule \nrevisions are proposed as RACM. \n\nThe proposed Chapter 117 NOX rulemaking would implement RACT requirements for owners or \noperators of stationary internal combustion engines, process heaters, ovens, and incinerators \nlocated at industrial, commercial, or institutional major sources of NOX in the Bexar County ozone \nnonattainment area. The proposed rulemaking would extend existing rule provisions in \nSubchapter B, Division 2 to additional sources due to the reclassification from moderate to serious \nozone nonattainment and the decrease in the major source NOX threshold from 100 to 50 or more \ntons per year (tpy) of NOX. \n\n \n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 2 \nJune 20, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2025-0339-RUL \n\nScope of the rulemaking: \nTCEQ is required to submit AD and RFP SIP revisions to EPA consistent with FCAA requirements \nfor areas classified as serious nonattainment for the 2015 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. The proposed \nChapter 117 NOX rulemaking would revise existing rule sections and add new rule provisions in \nexisting sections, as applicable, in Subchapter B, Division 2. The proposed changes would address \nrequired AD SIP elements for the Bexar County serious ozone nonattainment area by \nimplementing RACT for major NOX sources at the new major source threshold of 50 or more tpy. \n\nA.) Summary of what the rulemaking would do: \nThis proposed rulemaking would extend rule applicability of Subchapter B, Division 2 to stationary \ngas-fired engines fired on landfill gas, stationary diesel engines, process heaters, natural gas-fired \novens, and incinerators. Proposed revisions would include new emission standards and \nexemptions for the unit categories that would be new to the provisions of Subchapter B, Division \n2. The proposed rulemaking would also extend applicability of existing monitoring, testing, \nrecordkeeping, and reporting requirements associated with Division 2 to the newly affected major \nsources of NOX located in the Bexar County serious ozone nonattainment area. These monitoring, \ntesting, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements would be necessary to ensure compliance with \nthe new emission specifications, confirm eligibility for certain exemptions, and ensure that NOX \nemission reductions are achieved from the units that become subject to the requirements of \nSubchapter B, Division 2. \n\nFinally, the proposed rulemaking would revise the compliance schedule for Bexar County Ozone \nNonattainment Area Major Sources, in \u00a7117.9010 of Subchapter H, Division 1, by updating the \ncompliance deadline to March 1, 2026, to reflect the reclassification of the area to serious ozone \nnonattainment and the proposed new rule provision requirements. \n\nB.) Scope required by federal regulations or state statutes: \nThe new and amended rules implemented through this rulemaking, if adopted, are necessary to \naddress FCAA-required AD SIP elements for the Bexar County serious ozone nonattainment area, \nwhich include rules to implement serious classification NOX RACT. \n\nC.) Additional staff recommendations that are not required by federal rule or state statute: \nNon-substantive updates to Chapter 117 are recommended to remove obsolete language, use \nconsistent terminology, and update the rule language to conform to current Texas Register and \nTCEQ style and format requirements. \n\nStatutory authority: \nThe rule amendments are proposed under Texas Water Code (TWC), \u00a75.102, concerning General \nPowers, \u00a75.103, concerning Rules, and \u00a75.105, concerning General Policy, that authorize the \ncommission to adopt rules necessary to carry out its powers and duties under the TWC; and under \nTexas Health and Safety Code (THSC), \u00a7382.017, concerning Rules, that authorizes the commission \nto adopt rules consistent with the policy and purposes of the Texas Clean Air Act. The rules would \nalso be proposed under THSC, \u00a7382.002, concerning Policy and Purpose, that establishes the \ncommission\u2019s purpose to safeguard the state\u2019s air resources, consistent with the protection of \npublic health, general welfare, and physical property; \u00a7382.011, concerning General Powers and \nDuties, that authorizes the commission to control the quality of the state\u2019s air; \u00a7382.012, \nconcerning State Air Control Plan, that authorizes the commission to prepare and develop a \ngeneral, comprehensive plan for the control of the state\u2019s air; \u00a7382.014, Emissions Inventory, \nwhich authorizes the commission to require a person whose activities cause air contaminant \nemissions to submit information to enable the commission to develop an emissions inventory; \n\u00a7382.016, concerning Monitoring Requirements; Examination of Records, that authorizes the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 3 \nJune 20, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2025-0339-RUL \n\ncommission to prescribe requirements for owners or operators of sources to make and maintain \nrecords of emissions measurements; and \u00a7382.021, concerning Sampling Methods and Procedures, \nthat authorizes the commission to prescribe the sampling methods and procedures to determine \ncompliance with its rules. The rule amendments would also be proposed consistent with 42 United \nStates Code, \u00a7\u00a77420 et seq., which requires states to submit SIP revisions that specify the manner \nin which the NAAQS will be achieved and maintained within each air quality control region of the \nstate.  \n\nEffect on the: \n\nA.)  Regulated community: \nThe regulated community in Bexar County would be obligated to comply with, and may incur costs \nassociated with, any new rules adopted by the commission for Bexar County. To meet the emission \nspecifications in the proposed rules, owners or operators of affected sources may need to install \ncontrol equipment or modify sources. They would need to comply with monitoring, testing, and \nrecordkeeping requirements. Any costs associated with the new requirements would be incurred \nby the owner or operator of the affected NOX source. \n\nB.) Public: \nThe general public in Bexar County may benefit from NOX emissions reductions associated with \nany new or revised rules adopted by the commission. Reduced NOX emissions may result in less \nozone formation in the area, which may help improve air quality. \n\nC.) Agency programs: \nThis rulemaking would affect certain parts of the agency. Air Permits Division staff would be \nrequired to update Title V Operating Permits if new rules became applicable to more major \nsources. Additionally, staff in the Office of Compliance and Enforcement to conduct additional or \nexpanded investigations as a result of any new or amended regulations in Chapter 117. \n\nStakeholder meetings: \nThe commission did not hold any stakeholder meetings related to this rulemaking; however, if this \nproposed rulemaking is approved by the commission for public comment and public hearing, then \na formal public comment period will be opened, and a public hearing will be offered. \n\nPublic Involvement Plan \nYes. \n\nAlternative Language Requirements \nYes. Spanish. \n\nPotential controversial concerns and legislative interest: \nNone. \n\nWould this rulemaking affect any current policies or require development of new policies? \nThe rulemaking does not affect any current policies or require the development of new policies. \n\nWhat are the consequences if this rulemaking does not go forward? Are there alternatives to \nrulemaking? \nThe commission could choose to not comply with the requirements to develop and submit the \nChapter 117 rulemaking to EPA to address serious classification RACT requirements for Bexar \nCounty. However, a 2-to-1 emissions offset sanction will apply in the Bexar County nonattainment \narea 18 months after the effective date of a finding by EPA that TCEQ has failed to submit the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 4 \nJune 20, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2025-0339-RUL \n\nrequired SIP elements, unless TCEQ submits, and EPA deems complete, a plan revision that \nresolves the deficiency. Highway funding sanctions will apply six months after the offset sanction \nbegins if a complete plan revision has not been submitted to resolve the deficiency. In addition, \nEPA is required to promulgate a federal implementation plan within 24 months of the effective \ndate of a finding of failure to submit if TCEQ does not submit, or if TCEQ submits but EPA does \nnot approve, the required rules within the 24-month period. \n\nKey points in the proposal rulemaking schedule: \n\nAnticipated proposal date: July 9, 2025 \nAnticipated Texas Register publication date: July 25, 2025 \nAnticipated public hearing date: August 19, 2025 \nAnticipated public comment period: July 11, 2025 - August 25, 2025 \nAnticipated adoption date: December 17, 2025 \n\nAgency contacts: \nJavier Galv\u00e1n, Rule Project Manager, Air Quality Planning, (512) 239-6068 \nJohn Minter, Staff Attorney, Environmental Law Division, (512) 239-0663 \nGwen Ricco, Texas Register Rule/Agenda Coordinator, General Law Division, (512) 239-2678 \n\ncc: \n\nChief Clerk, 2 copies \nExecutive Director's Office \nPatrick Lopez \nJessie Powell \nKrista Kyle \nOffice of General Counsel \nJavier Galv\u00e1n \nJohn Minter \nTerry Salem \nGwen Ricco"

SB 1397 \npassed by the 88th Legislature, 2023, was authored by Senators Charles Schwertner, Nathan \nJohnson, Angela Paxton, Charles Perry, and Drew Springer, and sponsored by Representative Keith \nBell. The bill took effect September 1, 2023. \n\nScope of the rulemaking: \nThe executive director proposes revising Sections 60.1 and 60.2 of 30 Texas Administrative Code \n(TAC) Chapter 60. \n\nA.) Summary of what the rulemaking would do:  \nThis proposed rulemaking would revise 30 TAC Chapter 60 relating to Compliance History. The \nproposed rulemaking implements the changes made to TWC \u00a75.754 which require the \nconsideration of moderate and minor violations, in addition to the previously considered major \nviolations, when determining repeat violator status. This proposed rulemaking also addresses \nlegislative direction for TCEQ to review and update the compliance history rating formula to \nensure it adequately allows for comparing the compliance performance of facilities of similar \ncomplexity and to regularly update an entity\u2019s compliance history rating throughout the year. \n\nB.) Scope required by federal regulations or state statutes:   \nThere are no new federal regulations related to this rulemaking. SB 1397 amends TWC \u00a75.754. \n\nC.) Additional staff recommendations that are not required by federal rule or state statute:  \nStaff may make additional administrative changes as necessary to ensure consistency throughout \n30 TAC Chapter 60. \n\nStatutory authority: \nThe rulemaking is proposed under TWC \u00a75.753, concerning Standards for Evaluating and Using \nCompliance History; and TWC \u00a75.754, concerning Classification and Use of Compliance History, \nboth of which authorize rulemaking to establish compliance history standards. Additional \nauthority exists under TWC \u00a75.102, concerning General Powers, which provides the commission \nwith the general powers to carry out its duties under the TWC; and TWC \u00a75.103, concerning Rules, \nwhich provides the commission with the authority to adopt any rules necessary to carry out its \npowers and duties under the provisions of the TWC and other laws of this state.  \n\n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 2 \nJune 20, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2025-0520-RUL \n\nEffect on the: \n\nA.) Regulated community:  \nThe proposed rules do not affect current regulatory requirements for businesses or individuals. \nRegulated entities classified as repeat violators are subject to a 25% administrative penalty \nenhancement, and changes to how repeat violators are determined could result in increased \nadministrative penalties for some entities. Increasing the frequency that compliance history \ninformation is updated will allow regulated entities to review their ratings and file appeals on a \nmore frequent basis. \n\nB.) Public:  \nThe public benefit anticipated from the changes to the proposed rules will be the availability of \nmore current compliance history information as components are updated more than once per \nyear. No fiscal implications are anticipated. \n\nC.) Agency programs:  \nThe agency will be required to modify its compliance history data systems and reporting tools to \naccommodate changes to the compliance history program resulting from this rulemaking. The \nagency website will need to be updated to reflect changes, and the Advanced Review of \nCompliance History website will require changes. \n\nStakeholder meetings: \nThe commission did not hold any stakeholder meetings related to this rulemaking, however the \npublic was able to provide input and comments during committee hearings related to SB 1397 \nduring the 88th Legislative Session.  A rule public hearing will be held during the comment period \nin Austin. \n\nPublic Involvement Plan \nA public involvement plan is required. \n\nAlternative Language Requirements \nThere are alternative language requirements for this rulemaking. The notice for this statewide \nrulemaking will be published in Spanish. \n\nPotential controversial concerns and legislative interest: \nIt is expected that there will be interest in the new compliance history classification groups and \nrevised repeat violator criteria. \n\nWould this rulemaking affect any current policies or require development of new policies? \nThis rulemaking would not affect current policy or require the development of new policy. \n\nWhat are the consequences if this rulemaking does not go forward? Are there alternatives to \nrulemaking? \nRulemaking is required by SB 1397. If this rulemaking doesn\u2019t go forward, TCEQ would not be \ncompliant with the state statute. \n\nKey points in the proposal rulemaking schedule: \n\nAnticipated proposal date: July 9, 2025 \nAnticipated Texas Register publication date: July 25, 2025 \nAnticipated public hearing date: August 18, 2025 \nAnticipated public comment period: July 25, 2025 \u2013 August 25, 2025 \nAnticipated adoption date: November 19, 2025 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 3 \nJune 20, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2025-0520-RUL \n\nAgency contacts: \nKrista Clement, Rule Project Manager, Enforcement Division, (512) 239-1234 \nMisty James, Staff Attorney, Litigation Division, (512) 239-0631 \nGwen Ricco, Texas Register Rule/Agenda Coordinator, General Law Division, (512) 239-2678 \n\nAttachments:  \nSB 1397 \n\ncc: \n\nChief Clerk, 2 copies \nExecutive Director's Office \nPatrick Lopez \nJessie Powell \nKrista Kyle \nOffice of General Counsel \nPhillip Ledbetter \nAmy Settemeyer \nKrista Clement \nMisty James \nGwen Ricco"

Chism, Director   RCC \nOffice of Air  \n\nDocket No.: \n\n2023-1061-RUL \n\nSubject: \n\nCommission Approval for Proposed Rulemaking \nChapter 101, General Air Quality Rules \nFailure to Attain Fee for the 2008 Eight-Hour Ozone Standard  \nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI \n\nBackground and reason(s) for the rulemaking: \n\nOn October 7, 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published reclassifications for \nnonattainment areas under the 2008 eight-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard \n(NAAQS) of 0.75 parts per million, effective November 7, 2022 (87 Federal Register (FR) 60926). \nThe Dallas Fort-Worth (DFW) nonattainment area (Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Johnson, Kaufman, \nParker, Rockwall, Tarrant, and Wise Counties) and the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) \nnonattainment area (Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and \nWaller Counties) were reclassified from serious to severe nonattainment. The DFW and HGB \nnonattainment areas must attain the 2008 eight-hour ozone NAAQS by July 20, 2027, based on \n2024, 2025, and 2026 monitoring data.1 The preliminary 2024 design value for the DFW \nnonattainment is 83 parts per billion (ppb) and for HGB is 84 ppb. \n\nWith the severe classification, the DFW and HGB areas are subject to FCAA, \u00a7182(d)(3), which \nrequires states to submit plans to include the requirements of \u00a7185, Enforcement for Severe and \nExtreme Ozone Nonattainment Areas for Failure to Attain. Rules to address these requirements, \nreferred to as Section 185 fee rules, must be submitted to EPA by November 7, 2025. \n\nThis rulemaking would implement the FCAA, \u00a7185 requirements. The FCAA, \u00a7185(a) requires each \nstate implementation plan (SIP) to impose a penalty fee for major stationary sources of volatile \norganic compounds (VOC) located in the nonattainment area if the area fails to attain the ozone \nNAAQS by the applicable attainment date. Section \u00a7182(f) of the FCAA requires that all SIP \nprovisions applicable to VOC emissions also apply for nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions. The fee is \nrequired to be imposed for each calendar year after the missed attainment date until EPA \nredesignates the area as attainment for the 2008 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. If the state does not \nimpose and collect the fee, or if the state\u2019s fee provisions do not meet the FCAA requirements, \nthen FCAA, \u00a7185(d) requires that EPA impose and collect the fee with interest. The fee and interest \nwould not be returned to the state.  \n\nScope of the rulemaking: \nThe rulemaking would implement the required FCAA, \u00a7185 fee program for severe or extreme \n2008 eight-hour ozone NAAQS nonattainment areas that have failed to attain by the applicable \nattainment date.  \n\n1 The attainment year ozone season is the ozone season immediately preceding a nonattainment area\u2019s \nattainment deadline. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 2 \nApril 11, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2023-1061-RUL \n\nA.) Summary of what the rulemaking would do:  \nThese proposed new rules would establish the TCEQ Section 185 fee program for the 2008 eight-\nhour ozone NAAQS in Chapter 101, Subchapter K, Failure to Attain Fee for the 2008 Eight-Hour \nOzone Standard. \n\nThe proposed rulemaking includes applicability requirements, cessation of the program, \nexemption to the program, baseline amount determination options, fee assessment, calculation, \ncompliance schedules, collection, and payment. \n\nThe proposed fee calculation reflects the FCAA, \u00a7185 penalty fee rate. As stated in FCAA, \u00a7185, \nthe fee is $5,000 per ton, as adjusted annually for inflation by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), of \nNOX, VOC, or both emitted in excess of 80% of a major stationary source\u2019s baseline emissions. A \nmajor stationary source for NOX is subject to the fees on NOX emissions; a major stationary source \nfor VOC is subject to the fees on VOC emissions; and a major stationary source for both NOX and \nVOC is subject to the fee on emissions of both pollutants. The EPA-specified adjusted fee rate for \ncalendar year 2024 is $12,476.67 per ton.2 The major stationary source\u2019s baseline amount is \ndetermined as the lower of the actual emissions or allowable emissions during the attainment \nyear. \n\nThe proposed rulemaking offsets the nonattainment area\u2019s fee obligation using mobile source \ngrant program revenue, emissions-based alternatives to paying the fee, and baseline amount \ndetermination flexibilities. \n\nB.) Scope required by federal regulations or state statutes: \nThe rulemaking would implement the required FCAA, \u00a7185 fee program for severe or extreme \n2008 eight-hour ozone NAAQS nonattainment areas that have failed to attain by the applicable \nattainment date. The following FCAA requirements are included in the proposed rulemaking: \n\u2022  The baseline amount for each major stationary source is determined as the lower of a major \nstationary source\u2019s actual emissions (as reported in the annual emissions inventory) or \nauthorized emissions (from all applicable permits or authorizations) during the attainment \nyear.  \n\n\u2022  A major stationary source is annually assessed the Section 185 fee on emissions of NOX VOC, \n\nor both pollutants (depending on a source\u2019s major source determination), as reported in the \nannual emissions inventory, that exceed 80% of the source\u2019s baseline amount. \n\n\u2022  The fee calculation for annual fee assessment reflects the FCAA, \u00a7185-required penalty of \n\n$5,000 per ton as adjusted annually by the CPI.  \n\n\u2022  The Section 185 fee program would end when the area is redesignated as attainment by EPA. \nIf EPA approves a one-year extension of the attainment date for the nonattainment area, \n\u2022 \nmajor stationary sources would not have to pay the Section 185 fee for that extension year, \nbut the fee would be implemented upon failure to attain the extended attainment date. \n\nC.) Additional staff recommendations that are not required by federal rule or state statute: \nThe proposed rule includes various Section 185 fee program elements not specifically addressed \nin FCAA, \u00a7185 provisions that staff recommend including. Examples include:  \n\n\u2022  equivalent alternative fee program allowed under FCAA, \u00a7172(e) to offset all or a portion of \na nonattainment area\u2019s fee obligation with revenue collected from the Texas Emissions \nReduction Plan (TERP) expended within that severe nonattainment area;  \n\n2 https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-10/memorandum-sec-185-penalty-fees-for-\nyear-2024_0.pdf  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 3 \nApril 11, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2023-1061-RUL \n\n\u2022  provisions to fulfill an individual major stationary source\u2019s fee obligation by relinquishing \nemissions credits or investing in a supplemental environmental project specific to the \nsevere nonattainment area;  \n\n\u2022  baseline amount determination flexibilities such as aggregation by pollutant and/or sites \n\nunder common control;   \n\n\u2022  applicability and requirements for sources that become major during or after the \n\nattainment year; \n\n\u2022  adjustment of baseline amounts for specific situations that occur after the baseline year;  \n\u2022  determining baseline amounts for source\u2019s emissions that are irregular, cyclical, or \n\notherwise vary significantly from year to year; and \n\n\u2022  options to terminate the fee program or place the fee program in abeyance. \n\nStatutory authority: \nTexas Clean Air Act, \u00a7\u00a7382.011 382.012, 382.017 and 382.0622; and Texas Water Code, \u00a7\u00a75.102, \n5.103, 5.105 and 5.701 \n\nEffect on the: \n\nA.) Regulated community:  \nBased on recent emissions inventory and Title V data, this rulemaking could impact as many as \napproximately 180 DFW-area and approximately 280 HGB-area major stationary sources emitting \nNOX and/or VOC. The proposed rulemaking would require these sources to pay the penalty fee in \n2028 for an area that fails to attain the 2008 eight-hour ozone NAAQS by the July 20, 2027, \nattainment date.   \n\nIf the proposed rules are adopted, it is unknown if or how major stationary sources may choose to \nexercise the baseline amount flexibility options provided, whether future TERP revenue could \noffset the nonattainment\u2019s area fee obligation, and future fee rates; therefore, an accurate fee \nobligation for the nonattainment areas is not possible. Estimating a maximum potential fee \nobligation assuming no baseline amount flexibilities exercised, no emissions reductions from the \nbaseline, no fee offsets from TERP revenue, and an estimated future fee rate, the annual DFW fee \nobligation could be as much as $47 million per year, and the annual HGB obligation could be as \nmuch as $171 million per year. \n\nB.) Public: \nCitizens may be impacted if companies raise prices for goods and services or curtail or cease \noperations to meet FCAA, \u00a7185 fee obligations. If major stationary sources choose to reduce \nemissions to minimize or avoid the FCAA, \u00a7185 penalty fee, the public in both the DFW and HGB \nnonattainment areas may benefit from reduced ozone precursor emissions. \n\nC.) Agency programs: \nThis rulemaking would affect certain parts of the agency. The Air Quality Division would be \nrequired to implement the program and assess the fee annually.  \n\nSupport may be required from the Financial Administration Division of the Office of \nAdministrative Services to implement the fee invoicing process. Support from the Information \nResources Division in the Office of Administrative Services would be needed for database \nmaintenance and potential enhancements.  \n\nStakeholder meetings: \nPublic meetings for the DFW area were held virtually on August 24, 2022; September 6, 2022; and \nSeptember 7, 2022. TCEQ held a hybrid (in-person and virtual) meeting at the North Central Texas \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 4 \nApril 11, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2023-1061-RUL \n\nCouncil of Governments on February 17, 2023. HGB public meetings were held on July 28, 2022; \nSeptember 7, 2022; and September 8, 2022. TCEQ held a hybrid (in-person and virtual) meeting at \nthe Houston Area Council of Governments on April 26, 2023.  \n\nFormal stakeholder meetings were held virtually on August 6, 2024, for the DFW area and August \n8, 2024, for the HGB area, with simultaneous Spanish interpretation. Informal stakeholder \ncomments were solicited through September 9, 2024, and were considered during development of \nthis proposed rulemaking. Seven organizations submitted informal comments either supporting or \nopposing equivalent alternative or conventional fee programs. Comments were also provided on \nfee baseline amount determinations options. The informal comments received are posted on the \nStakeholder Group: Federal Clean Air Act Section 185 Fee webpage \n(https://www.tceq.texas.gov/airquality/point-source-ei/185-fee).  \n\nPublic Involvement Plan \nYes. \n\nAlternative Language Requirements \nYes. Spanish. \n\nPotential controversial concerns and legislative interest: \n\u2022  Alternative Methods to Meet Fee Obligation - EPA has not provided guidance for FCAA, \u00a7185 \n\nfee development specific to the 2008 eight-hour ozone NAAQS, and it directed states to \nconsult with the appropriate EPA Regional Office. During the informal comment period, \nstakeholders submitted comments in support of and in opposition to an equivalent \nalternative fee program.  \n\n\u2022  Baseline Amount Flexibility - Staff propose allowing baseline amount aggregation by \n\npollutant and/or sites under common control for sites located in the same nonattainment \narea. During the informal comment period, stakeholders submitted comments in support of \nand in opposition to baseline amount determination flexibilities.  \n\n\u2022  Baseline Amount Adjustments - Adjustments to established baseline amounts are proposed \n\nfor limited circumstances, which may not be considered approvable by EPA. \n\u2022  Cessation of Fee Program - The FCAA requires the fee to be paid until the area is \n\nredesignated as attainment by EPA. The proposed rulemaking provides that fee collection \ncould be held in abeyance with a finding of attainment by EPA or upon submission to EPA of \nthree consecutive years of quality-assured ambient monitoring data showing that no monitors \nexceed the NAAQS. As proposed, the executive director would have discretion to hold the \nprogram\u2019s fee collection in abeyance from the time that certified clean data were submitted to \nEPA until EPA has made a finding. This provision was adopted in the Section 185 fee program \nunder the revoked one-hour ozone NAAQS. EPA has not taken final action concerning these \nalternative criteria for the one-hour program, but its proposed disapproval action was \npublished on December 19, 2024 (89 FR 103734).    \n\nWould this rulemaking affect any current policies or require development of new policies? \nStaff would need to develop procedures to determine the fee obligation for each nonattainment \narea and collect and maintain data in association with this proposed rulemaking. Fiscal staff would \ninvoice the affected major stationary sources when necessary and collect the revenue.  \n\nWhat are the consequences if this rulemaking does not go forward? Are there alternatives to \nrulemaking? \nIf the state does not collect the fee or does not have an EPA-approved program, then under FCAA, \n\u00a7185(d), EPA must collect the fees with interest. These fees and interest would not be returned to \nthe state. No alternatives to a fee-based program are listed in FCAA, \u00a7182(d)(3) or \u00a7185. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 5 \nApril 11, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2023-1061-RUL \n\nKey points in the proposal rulemaking schedule: \n\nAnticipated proposal date: May 1, 2025 \nAnticipated Texas Register publication date: May 16, 2025 \nAnticipated public hearing date: June 12, 2025  \nAnticipated public comment period: May 6, 2025 - June 18, 2025  \nAnticipated adoption date: October 22, 2025  \n\nAgency contacts: \nDanielle Nesvacil, Emissions Assessment Section Manager, Air Quality Division, (512) 239-2102 \nJill Dickey-Hull, Technical Specialist, Air Quality Division, (512)-239-5912 \nJohn Minter, Staff Attorney, Environmental Law Division, (512) 239-0663 \nTerry Salem, Staff Attorney, Environmental Law Division, (512) 239-0469 \nGwen Ricco, Texas Register Rule/Agenda Coordinator, General Law Division, (512) 239-2678 \n\nAttachments:  \nFCAA, \u00a7185; https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2013-title42/html/USCODE-2013-\ntitle42-chap85-subchapI-partD-subpart2-sec7511d.htm \n\nImplementation of the 2008 National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone: State \nImplementation Plan Requirements (80 FR 12264); \nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/03/06/2015-04012/implementation-of-the-\n2008-national-ambient-air-quality-standards-for-ozone-state-implementation \n\ncc: \n\nChief Clerk, 2 copies \nExecutive Director\u2019s Office \nPatrick Lopez \nJessie Powell \nKrista Kyle \nOffice of General Counsel \nDanielle Nesvacil \nJill Dickey-Hull \nJohn Minter \nTerry Salem \nGwen Ricco  \nJamie Zech"

Additional staff recommendations that are not required by federal rule or state statute: \nStaff recommend an overall clean-up of the language in 30 TAC Chapter 114, Subchapters A and C, \nto remove outdated program-related definitions, references, and requirements, and to restructure \nthe rule language for clarity. The clean-up process would include revisions to remove 30 TAC \n\u00a7114.50(b)(2) related to vehicles operated by any federal government agency employee under the \njurisdiction of a federal government agency as the provision has not been approved as part of the \nSIP by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Language and definitions related to acceleration \nsimulation mode and two-speed idle testing that are no longer conducted would be removed as \nthose tests are no longer applicable. Language referencing the \u201csingle sticker transition date,\u201d as \ndefined in 30 TAC \u00a7114.1, would be removed, and the remaining rule language would be \nrestructured for clarity. \n\nStatutory authority: \nTexas Water Code (TWC), \u00a7 5.102 General Powers \nTWC, \u00a75.103, Rules \nTWC, \u00a75.105, General Policy \nTHSC, \u00a7382.017, Rules \nTHSC, \u00a7382.011, General Powers and Duties \nTHSC, \u00a7382.202, Vehicle Emissions Inspection and Maintenance Program \nTHSC, \u00a7382.203, Vehicles Subject to Program; Exemptions \nTHSC, \u00a7382.205, Inspection Equipment and Procedures \n\nEffect on the: \n\nA.) Regulated community: \nHB 3297 significantly impacts vehicle inspection stations in the state now that noncommercial \ninspections no longer include safety inspection items and inspection stations no longer earn a \n$7.00 safety inspection fee per vehicle. In the 17 counties where emissions inspections are \ncurrently required, noncommercial gasoline-powered vehicles two to 24 model-years old continue \nto receive an emissions inspection each year, and vehicle inspection stations were required to \ndownload and install an update to their emissions analyzer. For inspection stations, such analyzer \nupdates are part of the normal course of business. No appreciable affect is anticipated as a result \nof the SIP revision and rulemaking required of TCEQ to implement HB 3297. \n\nAs a result of the passage of SB 2102, passenger cars and light trucks that are to be initially \nregistered as rental vehicles may receive an initial three-year registration rather than the initial \ntwo-year registration given to other vehicles. Inspection stations and inspectors will be provided \nwith procedural guidance by the Texas Department of Public Safety as these vehicles previously \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fCommissioners \nPage 3 \nMarch 28, 2025 \n\nRe:  Docket No. 2025-0016-RUL  \n\nreceived an initial two-year safety inspection but no longer receive an initial safety inspection as of \nJanuary 1, 2025. \n\nB.) Public: \nAs a result of the passage of HB 3297, motorists with noncommercial vehicles in the 17 counties \nwhere emissions inspections are currently required no longer have their vehicles inspected for \nsafety inspection items on an annual basis. Motorists are charged $7.00 less by inspection stations \nfor an inspection. \n\nSB 2102 only affects owners of passenger cars and light trucks that are to be initially registered as \nrental vehicles. Vehicles in counties subject to I/M that are affected by this bill receive an \nadditional year of exemption from emissions inspection requirements; these vehicle owners would \nnot be required to have the vehicles inspected until the third year of ownership.  \n\nC.) Agency programs: \nNone. \n\nStakeholder meetings: \nThe commission did not hold any stakeholder meetings related to this rulemaking; however, if the \nproposed rulemaking is approved by the commission for public comment and public hearing, then \na formal public comment period would be opened, and a public hearing would be offered. \n\nPublic Involvement Plan \nYes. \n\nAlternative Language Requirements \nYes. Spanish. \n\nPotential controversial concerns and legislative interest: \nNone. \n\nWould this rulemaking affect any current policies or require development of new policies? \nThis rulemaking does not affect any current policies or require development of new policies. \n\nWhat are the consequences if this rulemaking does not go forward? Are there alternatives to \nrulemaking? \nThere is no alternative to rulemaking. HB 3297 and SB 2102 are required to be implemented. \n\nKey points in the proposal rulemaking schedule: \nAnticipated proposal date: April 17, 2025 \nAnticipated Texas Register publication date: May 2, 2025 \nAnticipated public hearing date: May 29, 2025 \nAnticipated public comment period: April 22, 2025, through June 3, 2025 \nAnticipated adoption date: September 24, 2025 \n\nAgency contacts: \nDavid Serrins, Rule Project Manager, Air Quality Division, (512) 239-1954 \nContessa N.
